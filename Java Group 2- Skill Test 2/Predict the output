Predict the output
What will be the output of the following code?
class Test 
{ 
    int a; 
    int b; 
    Test() 
    {   
        this(10, 20);   
        System.out.print("constructor one "); 
    } 
    Test(int a, int b) 
    { 
        this.a = a; 
        this.b = b; 
        System.out.print("constructor two "); 
    } 
}
class new_test{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        Test object = new Test(); 
    } 
} 
Options
This problem has only one correct answer
constructor one
constructor two
constructor two constructor one
constructor one constructor two

Hurray! Correct Answer      constructor two constructor one

Solution Description
When the object of Test class is created,the constructor with no arguments is called.
When  this(10,20) is encountered , the constructor with two arguments int and int is called because this is the reference of the object. So using this way we can call more than one constructor.
